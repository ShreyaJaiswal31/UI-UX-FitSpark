# FitSpark - Mobile App Design (Human Computer Interaction)

FitSpark is a mobile fitness application that motivates users to stay active by integrating wearable technology, daily challenges, and social competition. It tracks user activity such as steps, heart rate, and calories burned. FitSpark caters to both busy individuals looking for short, engaging workouts and fitness enthusiasts seeking detailed tracking and competition.
The purpose of this user testing was to evaluate the usability of the FitSpark prototype. The main goal was to gather real user feedback to identify pain points, understand user behavior, and inform improvements to the prototype.

## ✍️ Reflection

Creating personas and scenarios was a creative and analytical process. I based them on common fitness app users—like busy professionals and fitness lovers—drawing from personal experiences and observations.

The challenge was in making the personas realistic while highlighting FitSpark’s value. For instance:
- **Mike's need for competitive elements** emphasized the importance of social features.
- **Sarah’s time constraints** highlighted the need for quick, engaging workouts.

This design stage helped clarify user-centered priorities and reinforced the importance of **usability** and **engagement** in app development.
