# UI-UX-FitSpark

FitSpark is a mobile fitness application that motivates users to stay active by integrating wearable technology, daily challenges, and social competition. It tracks user activity such as steps, heart rate, and calories burned. FitSpark caters to both busy individuals looking for short, engaging workouts and fitness enthusiasts seeking detailed tracking and competition.
The purpose of this user testing was to evaluate the usability of the FitSpark prototype. The main goal was to gather real user feedback to identify pain points, understand user behavior, and inform improvements to the prototype.
